# Word Count _a la_ Gloo

Given a phrase, count the occurrences of each word in that phrase.

For example for the input `"olly olly in come free"`

```plain
olly: 2
in: 1
come: 1
free: 1
```


## Running the tests

#### Run once

`npm test`

#### Run Continuously

`npm run watch:test` 

## Making the Test Suite Pass

Execute the tests with:

    jasmine <exercise-name>.spec.js

**In many test suites all but the first test have been skipped.
Once you get a test passing, you can unskip the next one by
changing `xit` to `it`.**

This is a classic toy problem, but we were reminded of it by seeing it in the Go Tour.
